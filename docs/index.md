# Retiring the Nuclide Open Source Project

A few years ago, we introduced Nuclide to provide a first-class IDE experience. We've made tremendous strides, and it has been amazing to see a robust and hack-able text editor really come alive with language services, debugging, source control and code insight features.

We started building Nuclide to support our own engineers here at Facebook, and then sought to share as much of our work as possible with the open source community in the hopes that others could benefit from it too. However, our team has not been able to give this project the amount of attention and responsiveness it deserves and as a result we've made the difficult decision to retire Nuclide and associated repos, such as the Atom-IDE packages.

The current release of Nuclide will be our last. However, all of our source code will remain available in the [Facebook Open Source Archive](https://github.com/facebookarchive). The language and debugging services (including Hack and Flow Language Servers) in our repo will continue to work in Atom and other compatible IDEs such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code or any of the clients listed here: [www.langserver.org](http://www.langserver.org/). It is our hope that it will continue to be useful to developers, and we welcome the community to continue where we left off, subject to the license terms in the repository.

We are extremely grateful for the contributions, feedback and support we've received from the community, especially Github's Atom team, that helped us get where we are today.
